  <p>
    I am a student at Parsons School of Design in New York City. I am studying
    Product and Communication design, finding drive and passion in both 2D and
    3D mediums. As a Junior, I am still finding who I want to be as a designer,
    actively searching for my identity. <br />
    <br />
    This is a growing collection of my work, that is subject to change with
    experience. My interest's and passion's fluctuate, and my focus shifts
    rapidly.
    <br />
    <br />
    I am a sponge. There is always more to learn.
